# Chatter Craft

Collaborate on a shared canvas using just your voice.

This application was built using [Convex](https://convex.dev) for the [WebDevCody Hackathon](https://hackathon.webdevcody.com/)

## Install

You should be able to download and then `yarn install` then `yarn dev` to have it run locally.

It will require a Convex account to work but running `yarn dev` will take you through that.
