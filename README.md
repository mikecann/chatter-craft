# Chatter Craft

Collaborate on a shared canvas using just your voice.

This application was built using [Convex](https://convex.dev) for the [WebDevCody Hackathon](https://hackathon.webdevcody.com/)

There is a running demo hosted here: https://chatter-craft.netlify.app/ I have a limited amount of OpenAI credit so once it runs out, the app may no longer work! 

## Install

You should be able to download and then `yarn install` then `yarn dev` to have it run locally.

It will require a Convex account to work but running `yarn dev` will take you through that.

You will need to create a new `.env.local`, see `example.env.local` for whats needed in there. 

You will also need to add an `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable on Convex
